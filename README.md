# 🌐 Intelligent Healthcare with Explainable AI 🌐

## 🚀 Project Overview
Harnessing the power of Explainable AI, this project pioneers a smart healthcare prototype for predicting communicable diseases. Our solution continuously monitors vital health parameters, employing an Explainable Stacked Model to provide transparent and accurate infection risk predictions.

## 🏗️ Smart Healthcare Ecosystem
Experience the future with our comprehensive system architecture:
- Cutting-edge medical sensors for real-time data collection 🌡️
- Localized edge devices for efficient storage and processing 🖥️
- Cloud storage for seamless historical data monitoring ☁️
- User-friendly mobile app for personalized health status tracking 📱

## 📊 Data Intelligence
Data-driven insights are at the core:
- Collection from medical sensors: temperature, SpO2, etc.
- Robust handling of missing values with mean imputation
- Feature selection to eliminate redundancies
- Correlation analysis for identifying and removing highly correlated parameters
- Addressing class imbalance with SMOTE oversampling

## 🧠 Advanced Machine Learning Model
Our XStacked model, combining Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, ensures robust predictions. Probability outputs from the base models are skillfully stacked, flowing into a Random Forest meta-model for conclusive infection risk assessment.
